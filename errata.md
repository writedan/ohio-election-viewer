# Errata

There is no clean manner of associating precincts to townships or municipalities. I have endeavored to attempt it, but there are certainly many precincts associated to the wrong municipality. As these are discovered, I will correct them.

Many precincts in Coshocton County are aggregations of two or three or even four townships. These ought then be merged on the map. This is also true of Crawford. Wheeling and Monroe counties, Guernsey County, are similarly consolidated. Monroe and Pike townships; Paint, Range, and Stokes townships, Monroe County.

Jefferson County has many precincts which do not correspond to municipalities, and thus much of its aggregation is guesswork.

Harbor View Village, Lucas County is within Oregon City Precinct 1, but not coterminus with it.

Perry Township, Mahoning County, is probably reported with Green County.

Grand and Salt Rock Townships; Scott and Tully Townships are reported together, Marion county.

Medina County has many, many county subdivisions being covered by multiple precincts.

Wayne Township, Mercer County, is reported with Center Township.

Precincts "Page Manor" have been considered part of Dayton city, Montgomery County.

Union and Homer townships, Morgan county are reported under one precinct.

Brookfield nad Noble Townships, Noble County are reported under one precinct.
Buffalo and Seneca Townships.
