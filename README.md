# Errata

There is no clean manner of associating precincts to townships or municipalities. I have endeavored to attempt it, but there are certainly many precincts associated to the wrong municipality. As these are discovered, I will correct them.

Many precincts in Coshocton County are aggregations of two or three or even four townships. These ought then be merged on the map. This is also true of Crawford.
